# CanvasFlow

**A canvas-first form builder with durable data keys and real-time analytics.**

Drag fields onto an open canvas, connect them like nodes, watch responses light up your dashboard. Built as a Turborepo monorepo with a Next.js studio, an Express + tRPC API, and a Drizzle / PostgreSQL data layer.

---

## Highlights

- **Canvas-first builder** powered by [`@xyflow/react`](https://reactflow.dev). Twelve field types: short / long text, email, phone, URL, number, single select, checkbox, rating, toggle, date, time.
- **Durable field keys.** Every field gets an immutable slug the moment it's created — rename labels freely and your webhooks, exports, and analytics never break.
- **Real-time analytics.** Response timeline, device breakdown, day-of-week, completion rate, submissions table with virtualisation and CSV export.
- **One submission per visitor.** Partial unique index on `(form_id, visitor_id)` with a client-side lockout screen — visitors can't submit twice even by clearing localStorage.
- **Idempotency on every submit.** A client-generated `idempotency_key` collapses double-clicks and network retries into a single record.
- **Pro-tier paywall** for detailed analytics, with Free / Pro / Pro+ / Business tiers wired into the API and UI.
- **Optimistic-lock versioning** on forms and fields so concurrent edits surface conflicts instead of silently overwriting.

## Architecture

```
apps/
  web/    Next.js 16 studio — landing, auth, dashboard, builder, public form pages
  api/    Express + tRPC server, OpenAPI bridge, rate limiting, Better Auth mount

packages/
  database/        Drizzle schema, models, migrations, shared pg pool
  services/        Pure business logic (form / form-field / form-submission / analytics)
  trpc/            tRPC router + shared client; auth, context, route definitions
  logger/          Winston wrapper used by api and services
  eslint-config/   Shared ESLint config (Next + Prettier)
  typescript-config/  Shared tsconfig presets
```

The `services` package is framework-agnostic — all SQL, validation, and business rules live there. `trpc` is a thin transport layer that calls services, and `apps/api` only owns process lifecycle (express, CORS, rate-limit, scalar docs).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **Node ≥ 20** (`engines` is pinned)
- **pnpm 9**
- A PostgreSQL database. Either:
  - a free [Neon](https://neon.tech) project (recommended), or
  - the bundled `docker-compose.yml` for local Postgres on port 5432.

### 1. Install

```sh
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

The repo expects a single `.env` at the root that is hard-linked into every workspace by `setup.sh`. The Better Auth secret, database URL, and OAuth credentials all live here.

```sh
cp .env.example .env   # if you have one, otherwise create from the template below
bash setup.sh          # links the root .env into apps/*/.env and packages/*/.env
```

Minimum required keys:

```env
# API
PORT=8000
NODE_ENV=development
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Database (Neon or local Postgres)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname

# Better Auth
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:8000
WEB_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Web
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Optional — OAuth providers (server skips them gracefully if absent)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

### 3. Set up the database

```sh
# Optional: spin up local Postgres
docker compose up -d

# Generate + apply Drizzle migrations
pnpm db:generate
pnpm db:migrate
```

### 4. Run dev

```sh
pnpm dev
```

This boots, in parallel:

| URL | What |
| --- | --- |
| `http://localhost:3000` | Next.js studio (web) |
| `http://localhost:8000/trpc` | tRPC HTTP endpoint |
| `http://localhost:8000/docs` | Auto-generated Scalar API reference |
| `http://localhost:8000/openapi.json` | OpenAPI 3.1 spec |

Sign up at `/signUp`, build a form, publish it, share `/forms/<id>`, watch responses populate `/dashboard/analytics`.

## Scripts

All scripts are turbo-orchestrated and `dotenv -- ...` wrapped so workspaces share the root env.

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm dev` | Run every workspace's dev task |
| `pnpm build` | Build the API and the web app for production |
| `pnpm lint` | ESLint across all workspaces (zero-warning) |
| `pnpm check-types` | TypeScript no-emit type-check |
| `pnpm format` | Prettier across `**/*.{ts,tsx,md}` |
| `pnpm db:generate` | Generate a Drizzle migration from schema changes |
| `pnpm db:migrate` | Apply pending migrations |

Filter to a single workspace with `pnpm -F web <script>` or `pnpm -F @repo/api <script>`.

## Design decisions worth knowing

- **Single-statement dashboard query.** `form.getDashboardStats` is one SQL `WITH owned AS (...)` CTE that returns `forms`, totals, per-form counts, and the 90-day trend as JSON in a single round-trip. The pg pool is also pre-warmed with four sockets at boot, so the first burst of concurrent queries doesn't pay parallel TLS handshakes to Neon. Result: dashboard loads in ~250ms warm and stays under 300ms even when fired alongside other authed calls.
- **`Server-Timing` headers** are emitted from every authed tRPC procedure (`auth;dur=… inner;dur=…`). Visible in DevTools Network panel — useful for diagnosing whether a slow request was auth or query.
- **React Query staleTime caching** on dashboard / list / analytics hooks (30–60s) so in-app back-navigation paints instantly. Mutations always `invalidate()` on success, so stale data can't survive a real write.
- **Visitor lockout** is enforced in three places: the UI hides the form behind a `cf_submitted_<formId>` localStorage flag, the API service does a `(form_id, visitor_id)` lookup before insert, and a partial unique index on the same tuple wins races at the DB level.
- **Field type validation in the public form** does format checks for `EMAIL` (`/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/`) and `URL` (`new URL()`) — both block forward navigation and surface a sonner toast.
- **Code splitting.** Recharts widgets and the heaviest analytics components are loaded via `next/dynamic` per route. The submissions virtualised table mounts its detail modal only when a row is clicked.
- **Pricing tiers** are enforced server-side in `packages/services/form-submission/index.ts` (monthly submission caps) and `packages/trpc/server/trpc.ts` (`proAuthenticatedProcedure` for detailed analytics).

## Deployment (production)

The repo ships a full CI/CD pipeline for a single-VM production setup (Ubuntu 24.04). Two subdomains, in-place overwrite deploys, zero-downtime PM2 reloads. Nginx and TLS are configured **manually on the VM** (not from the repo) — installed by `bootstrap.sh`, then you write the site configs yourself.

### Production architecture

```
GitHub push to main
   │
   ▼
GitHub Actions (.github/workflows/deploy.yml)
   ├─ pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
   ├─ pnpm build       (Next standalone + tsup bundle)
   ├─ pnpm deploy …    (self-contained api/ and db/ bundles)
   ├─ tar              canvasflow-release.tar.gz
   ├─ scp tarball + release.sh to VM
   └─ ssh → bash release.sh /tmp/canvasflow-release.tar.gz
                │
                ▼
       VM (~deploy/canvasflow/)
       ├─ .env                          ← prod secrets, never overwritten
       ├─ web/, api/, db/               ← replaced atomically each deploy
       ├─ ecosystem.config.cjs
       └─ PM2 ─▶ web on 127.0.0.1:3000
                └▶ api on 127.0.0.1:8000

       Nginx :443 ─▶ canvasflow.<root>     → 127.0.0.1:3000
                  └▶ api.canvasflow.<root> → 127.0.0.1:8000
```

Each deploy extracts the new bundle into a temp dir, runs DB migrations from it (so a broken migration aborts before files are swapped), then `rsync --delete --exclude='.env'`s the temp dir over `~/canvasflow/` and reloads PM2.

### Step 1 — Bootstrap the VM

```sh
# SSH in as a sudo-capable user (not the deploy user):
git clone https://github.com/<you>/<repo> /tmp/canvasflow
bash /tmp/canvasflow/scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

This installs Node 20, pnpm 9, PM2, Nginx, certbot, a 4GB swap file, `ufw`, and creates the `deploy` user + base directory at `/home/deploy/canvasflow/`. Idempotent — safe to re-run.

### Step 2 — Configure secrets

1. Paste the GitHub Actions deploy key's **public** part into `/home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys`.
2. Fill in `/home/deploy/canvasflow/.env` with production values (see `.env.example`; pay attention to `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`, `TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, `COOKIE_DOMAIN`).
3. In OAuth provider consoles (Google / GitHub), add the production redirect URIs:
   - `https://api.<your-domain>/api/auth/callback/google`
   - `https://api.<your-domain>/api/auth/callback/github`

### Step 3 — Set GitHub Secrets / Variables

Under **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**:

| Kind | Key | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Secret | `SSH_HOST` | VM public IP or DNS name |
| Secret | `SSH_USER` | `deploy` |
| Secret | `SSH_PORT` | `22` |
| Secret | `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | Private half of the deploy keypair |
| Secret | `SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` | `ssh-keyscan -H <ssh_host>` output |
| Variable | `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL_PROD` | `https://api.<your-domain>` |

### Step 4 — First deploy

Push to `main`. GH Actions will build, ship the bundle, run migrations, flip the `current` symlink, and start PM2. After the workflow turns green, the processes are listening on `127.0.0.1:3000` and `127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Step 5 — Nginx + TLS (one-time, manual on the VM)

Nginx is installed by `bootstrap.sh`. The site configs are managed by hand on the VM — write two server blocks, one per subdomain, then let certbot bolt TLS onto them.

```sh
# On the VM (any user with sudo)
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/canvasflow-web   # see template below
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/canvasflow-api   # see template below

sudo ln -sf /etc/nginx/sites-available/canvasflow-web /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo ln -sf /etc/nginx/sites-available/canvasflow-api /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx

sudo certbot --nginx \
  -d canvasflow.<your-domain> \
  -d api.canvasflow.<your-domain>
```

Server block — web (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/canvasflow-web`):

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    listen [::]:80;
    server_name canvasflow.<your-domain>;
    location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ { root /var/www/html; }
    location / { return 301 https://$host$request_uri; }
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name canvasflow.<your-domain>;

    # SSL block managed by certbot — leave blank initially; certbot fills it in.

    client_max_body_size 10m;

    location / {
        proxy_pass         http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header   Host              $host;
        proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_set_header   Upgrade           $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header   Connection        "upgrade";
    }
}
```

Server block — api (`/etc/nginx/sites-available/canvasflow-api`): same shape, swap `127.0.0.1:3000` for `127.0.0.1:8000` and `canvasflow.<your-domain>` for `api.canvasflow.<your-domain>`. No `Upgrade`/`Connection` headers needed.

### Rollback

There's no on-VM rollback script — the deploy is in-place. To roll back:

1. Go to **Actions → Deploy → Run workflow**.
2. Pick the previous good commit as the ref.
3. Run.

The previous code is rebuilt and deployed in ~3 minutes. Database migrations are forward-only — code rollback won't undo schema changes, so be careful with destructive migrations.

## Contributing

1. Branch off `main`.
2. Run `pnpm check-types && pnpm lint` before pushing.
3. Add a Drizzle migration (`pnpm db:generate`) for any schema change and commit both the SQL and the snapshot JSON.
4. Keep business logic in `packages/services`; the tRPC layer should stay thin.
