/**
 * Shared connection pool.
 *
 * Why explicit values (instead of node-postgres defaults):
 * - `max: 10`     — Neon's free tier caps total active connections per
 *                   project at ~100. With a single API instance plus
 *                   Better Auth's own pool, 10 leaves plenty of headroom
 *                   and prevents one runaway request from starving auth.
 *                   Raise this once you're on a paid Neon plan or you'll
 *                   see "remaining connection slots" errors from Postgres.
 * - `idleTimeoutMillis: 5min` — Neon's TCP layer closes idle sockets
 *                   after ~5 minutes anyway, so we keep the pool a hair
 *                   under that. The previous 30s value was making every
 *                   request on a quiet endpoint pay the full TLS+
 *                   handshake cost (~250–700ms to us-east). Pairs with
 *                   `keepAlive: true` so the sockets we hold stay live.
 * - `keepAlive: true` — turns on TCP keep-alive so idle sockets aren't
 *                   silently dropped by Neon's load balancer; without
 *                   this we'd hit `read ETIMEDOUT` and reconnect on the
 *                   next request, eating ~300ms.
 * - `connectionTimeoutMillis: 10s` — fail fast if the database isn't
 *                                    reachable instead of hanging the
 *                                    request indefinitely.
 *
 * Shared by the app queries and Better Auth's drizzle adapter.
